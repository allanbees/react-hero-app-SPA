# SPA hero app

Made in the react.js udemy course by Fernando Herrera

The purpose of this app was learning how to create a single page application (SPA) using different hooks and the newest version of react router dom (V6) by understanding concepts like routes, routers and how to handle query parameters using npm query-string. The site has public and private routes, the functionality can be seen by the login demo that does not allow you to move into the content of the page until you click the login button, once clicked the private routes are displayed and information of heroes can be seen. The site also has a search bar that allows filtering heroes.
